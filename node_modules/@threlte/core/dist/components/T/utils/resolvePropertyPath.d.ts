/**
 * ### `resolvePropertyPath`
 *
 * Threlte supports props called "pierced props" that allow you to set
 * properties on nested objects. This function resolves a property path to a
 * target object and the property key. The property path can include dots to indicate
 * nested objects.
 *
 * ```svelte
 * <T.PerspectiveCamera position.x={10} />
 * ```
 *
 * … resolves to …
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { target, key } = resolvePropertyPath(camera, 'position.x')
 * target[key] = 10
 * ```
